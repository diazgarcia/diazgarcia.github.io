### Join us!
Prospective graduate students interested in doing grapevine breeding/genetics/genomics research are encouraged to apply through the [Agronomy and Horticulture graduate program](https://ggha.ucdavis.edu). Depending on common interests, experience, and academic background, students enrolled in Viticulture and Enology BS/MS programs at UC Davis might join the lab. We are a multidisciplinary team; prospective members of the lab (undergrads, grads, or postdocs) with computing science, engineering, physics, or other similar fields, are welcome to discuss lab opportunities. For international students, please consider funding agencies in your respective country. In any case, please send a letter/email explaining your interests and reasons to join the lab, along with a CV detailing your academic background, and relevant research experience to diazgarcia@ucdavis.edu. Before contacting, please research the lab, read our papers, and think about how we could work together.
