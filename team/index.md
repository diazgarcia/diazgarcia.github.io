### Join us!
Prospective graduate students interested in grapevine breeding, genetics, and genomics research are encouraged to apply through the [Agronomy and Horticulture graduate program](https://ggha.ucdavis.edu). We are a multidisciplinary team, and prospective lab members (undergraduates, graduate students, or postdocs) with backgrounds in biology, genetics, agronomy, computer science, physics, or related fields are welcome to discuss lab opportunities. For international students, please explore funding options available through agencies in your respective countries. If you are interested in joining the lab, please send a letter or email explaining your interests and reasons for applying, along with a CV detailing your academic background and relevant research experience, to diazgarcia at ucdavis.edu. Before reaching out, please take the time to research the lab, read our publications, and consider how we could collaborate effectively.
