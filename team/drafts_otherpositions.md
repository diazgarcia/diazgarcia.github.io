### Ph.D. student - Genetics of biotic and abiotic resistance/tolerance

We are hiring a Ph.D. student to work in grape genetics and genomics, particularly for mapping traits related to resistance/tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. 

#### Qualifications
 
 - Applicants must meet the qualifications for the [Agronomy and Horticulture graduate program](https://ggha.ucdavis.edu)
 - Research experience in plant biology, genetics, genomics, or related area
 - Programming skills (R or Python) are strongly desired
 - Excellent written and verbal communication skills
 - Be available to start working in January 2023

#### Application

Please email Luis Diaz-Garcia (diazgarcia@ucdavis.edu) the following documents. The position will remain open and we will receive applications until filling the position.

 - CV
 - Cover letter describing how candidates meet the above qualifications, and the candidate’s research interests and career goals
 - Most recent transcripts (undergraduate or graduate)
 - Contact information (email and current position) for three references
 - For international students, please check the [SISS](https://siss.ucdavis.edu) for more information about VISA, TOEFL, employment authorization, and other requirements





### Postdoc - Phenomics

We have an open postdoc position (1 year, renewable up to 4 years) to work in the development and implementation of high-throughput, high-dimensional phenotyping strategies in grapes. This research project will involve the deployment of rovers and UAVs in the vineyard for LIDAR data acquisition, the establishment of stations for leaf and root phenotyping, and a variety of other phenomics procedures. Phenotyping data will be coupled with molecular information for gene mapping and marker-assisted breeding. The postdoc will work on a diverse collection of *Vitis* germplasm, including major cultivars, as well as wild species of relevance for breeding. The postdoc will be expected to share findings with stakeholders at grower meetings and outreach events, support the mentoring of students, and publish results in peer-reviewed journals. Stipend and benefits will be [standard for UC Davis](https://gradstudies.ucdavis.edu/understanding-your-student-salary). Potential exists for a permanent position, after the postdoc, if the candidate can successfully lead the area of phenomics and work as a team member with the rest of the grapevine breeding group.

#### Qualifications
 
 - Strong background in plant breeding, plant genomics, quantitative genetics, or related area, with experience running sensors, image analysis, UAVs, or other phenomics pipelines
 - Excellent written and verbal communication skills
 - Having published at least one research article as first/corresponding author

#### Application

Please email Luis Diaz-Garcia (diazgarcia@ucdavis.edu) the following documents. This position is available to start as soon as September 2022, or as soon as a candidate is available.
