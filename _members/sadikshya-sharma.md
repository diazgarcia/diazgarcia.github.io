I received my undergraduate degree in Agriculture from Tribhuvan University, Nepal, and my master's degree from the University of Florida. Then, I joined the strawberry breeding genetics and genomics lab at the University of Florida as a lab technician where I learned about plant breeding and genomics. I'm interested in applying quantitative genetics, genomics, and molecular approaches to breeding better plants. In the Diaz-Garcia lab, I will be working on integrating genomic and phenomic tools for grape breeding. I enjoy hiking and traveling in my free time
