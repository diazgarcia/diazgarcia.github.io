Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor and Director of the Grapevine Breeding Program at the Viticulture and Enology Department at UC Davis. I completed my BS in Agronomy at [Universidad Autonoma Chapingo](https://www.chapingo.mx), and an MS in Plant Biotechnology at [CINVESTAV](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/en/). More recently, I obtained my Ph.D. in Plant Breeding and Plant Genetics at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://cggl.horticulture.wisc.edu) working in cranberry genetics and genomics. Before joining UC Davis, I was a lead scientist at [INIFAP-Mexico](http://www.inifap.gob.mx), where I applied genomics and phenomics approaches on underutilized crops such as guava.
