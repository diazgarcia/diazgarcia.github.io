Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor and Director of the grapevine breeding program at the Viticulture and Enology Department at UC Davis. I completed my BS in Agronomy at Universidad Autonoma Chapingo (Mexico), and an MS in Plant Biotechnology at LANGEBIO (MS). More recently, I obtained my PhD in Plant Breeding and Plant Genetics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working in cranberry genetics and genomics. Before joining UC Davis, I was a lead scientist at INIFAP-Mexico, where I applied genomics and phenomics approaches on underutilized crops such as guava.
