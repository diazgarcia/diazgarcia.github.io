I am an undergraduate student majoring in Environmental Science and Management at UC Davis. I love working with plants and I have spent time in the UC Davis Arboretum Teaching Nursery learning about nursery management and plant propagation. I also love to travel, I spent a month in France studying Viticulture and Enology through the UC Davis Summer Abroad program.
